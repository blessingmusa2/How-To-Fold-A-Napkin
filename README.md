Position the Fold: Turn the napkin so the open corner faces the top right.
Fold the Top Layer : Take the top layer of the top right corner and fold it down diagonally to the bottom left.
Fold the Next Layer : Repeat the process with the next layer, folding it slightly lower than the first fold.
Continue Folding: Repeat for each layer, creating a staggered look.
